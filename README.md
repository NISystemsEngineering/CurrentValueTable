# Current Value Table (CVT)
Many control applications require a mechanism to store and manage data in one location in the application so that different parts of the application have access to the current value of I/O channels and others variables. The Current Value Table (CVT) is a set of LabVIEW VIs that developers use to store and retrieve data asynchronously from different parts of an application.

###The LabVIEW version used for the CVT is 2010. Please ensure that all pull requests use 2010. If you do not have 2010, be sure to use features supported in 2010 -- that is, don't use auto-indexing, async call by ref, or any other features added in the last few years.
