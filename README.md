# CurrentValueTable
Many control applications require a mechanism to store and manage data in one location in the application so that different parts of the application have access to the current value of I/O channels and others variables. The Current Value Table (CVT) is a set of LabVIEW VIs that developers use to store and retrieve data asynchronously from different parts of an application.
